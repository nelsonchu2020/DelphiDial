# DelphiDial
Sample code to use Surface Dial from Delphi

VSProj folder contains a VS project modified from the sample code from Microsoft. Compile to a DLL using Visual Studio.

Delphi folder contains Delphi code that uses the Surface Dial API via the DLL. TODO: provide sample project.

Very baisc work on bridging the Dial API for use from Delphi. Currently it can do rotation and click events.

TODO:
1. Make it possible to send menu item string from Delphi to VC in order to create custom menu from Delphi. 
2. On-screen usage of the Dial.
