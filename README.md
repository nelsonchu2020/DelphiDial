# DelphiDial
Sample code to use Surface Dial from Delphi

VSProj folder contains a VS project modified from the sample code from Microsoft. Compile to a DLL using Visual Studio.

Delphi folder contains a Delphi project that uses the Surface Dial API via the DLL.

Very baisc work on bridging the Dial API for use from Delphi. Currently it can do rotation and click events.

TODO:
1. Make it possible to send menu item string from Delphi to VC in order to create custom menu from Delphi. 
2. On-screen usage of the Dial.
